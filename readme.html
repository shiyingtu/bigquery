<h3>Service Account</h3>
<p>
This app requires a pre-configured service account to operate. Please follow the procedure outlines at
<a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7378726?hl=en">this link</a> to create a service account.<br>
The following API will need to be enabled:<ul><li>Bigquery API</li></ul>
At the end of the creation process, the admin console should ask you to save the config as a JSON file.
Copy the contents of the JSON file in the clipboard and paste it as the value of the "Contents of Service Account JSON file" asset configuration parameter.
Double check to make sure that the "project_id" is the same project being used with BigQuery.
</p>

<h3>Roles</h3>
<p>
Once the service account has been created, you will then need to give the account the correct role. To do this, find
"IAM & admin" on the menu to the left on the Google Cloud Console homepage. From there, find your service account, and give it the
role "Bigquery Admin".
