<h3>Service Account</h3>
<p>
This app requires a pre-configured service account to operate. Please follow the procedure outlines at
<a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7378726?hl=en">this link</a> to create a service account.<br>
The following API will need to be enabled:<ul><li>Bigquery API</li></ul>
At the end of the creation process, the admin console should ask you to save the config as a JSON file.
Copy the contents of the JSON file in the clipboard and paste it as the value of the <b>key_json</b> asset configuration parameter.
Double check to make sure that the "project_id" is the same project being used with BigQuery.
</p>

<h3>Roles</h3>
<p>
Once the service account has been created, you will then need to give the account the correct role. To do this, find
"IAM & admin" on the menu to the left on the Google Cloud Console homepage. From there, find your service account, and give it the
role "Bigquery Admin".
